Description: Implementing the interventional effects for mediation analysis for up to 3 mediators.
    The methods used are based on VanderWeele, Vansteelandt and Robins (2014) <doi:10.1097/ede.0000000000000034>, 
    Vansteelandt and Daniel (2017) <doi:10.1097/ede.0000000000000596> and Chan and Leung (2020; unpublished manuscript, available on request from the author of this package).
    Linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression are used for continuous, binary 
    and count mediator/outcome variables respectively.
